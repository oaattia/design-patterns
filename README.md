## Introduction
 
I wanted in this repo to write implementation for Design Patterns, so i can fully understand them . 

You will see a folder for every design pattern in this repo, and also there is a test for every design pattern in `tests` folder . 

## Install 

```
composer install
```

this will install phpunit for running tests . 

### Some Design Patterns: 

- Factory design pattern ( creational design pattern ) . 
- Template design pattern : get the subclass duplicated code to abstract class .
- Adapter design pattern : is to create a class that can change the behaviour of sub class .
- Decorator Design pattern : is to create a abstract class to decorate injected class .
- Facade Design pattern : is to implement a gate to interact with all the classes behind it 
- Singleton design pattern : is to create one instance from the class through the application cycle .
